        <h2>Courses and Program</h2>
        <p>I am in the Business Technology Program, aiming for a Bachelor in Commerce. One of the most useful courses I found was <strong>ITM 200: Fundamentals of Programming</strong>. This course was helpful in teaching essential programming skills, including logic development, error handling, and modular design, all applied in a business context through hands-on labs.</p>
